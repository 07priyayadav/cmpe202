# LAB 9 - Java Lambda Design Pattern

## Implementation of Strategy design pattern in traditional with and without using the Lambda expression.

#### In this lab I have implemeted stategy pattern to calculate the area of square as - area by feets and area by meters.

## Comparision

### Original Strategy Pattern

a. Original Strategy pattern implementation have a lot of boilerplate code to code.

b. Creates different implementations (different classes with the implementation of algorithms) of the Strategy interface.


### Strategy Pattern using Lambda expression

a. Lambda expression redues a lot of boilerplate code to achieve concise code.

b. Implemention using Lambda expression does not creates different implementations (different classes with the implementation of algorithms) of the Strategy interface.
